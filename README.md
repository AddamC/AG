A generic algorithm approach made in Processing.

This project simulates a set of "characters" traveling in a field amongst objects in which it might collide. The criteria here for better routes is which object the character collides and/or avoid. Red ones are bad and purple ones are good.

As time passes, better routes will be taken (avoiding red objects and going through purple ones more frequently).
